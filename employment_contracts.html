            <h2>Awards vs Enterprise Agreements</h2>
            <p>Awards are the minimum guidelines set by the Fair Work Commission who decide the minimum rates for employment based on their industry. Awards are legally binding documents that if breached, can result in severe penalties and employees may take legal action if necessary.</p>
            <p>Agreements are legally binding documents that bend the terms of NES Awards but must not be lower than the already set minimum conditions. Main reasons why employers would use agreements are to clearly outline the agreements for the contract/clear expectations, legal protection, proper dispute resolution. Simpler definition use for presentation, “Outline the Term and Conditions of employment”</p>

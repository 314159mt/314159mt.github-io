            <h2>Fair Work Act 2009</h2>
            <p>The Fair Work Act was passed in 2009 by the Rudd Administration which was famously renowned for repealing the WorkChoices legislation 2005 (Administered by John Howard) which greatly restricted trade union activity as it shut down workers ability to legally go on strike as well as bargain without collectivised representation.</p>

            <p>The Fair Work act 2009 has had a large number of amendments made to it throughout the years. The Fair Work Ombudsman states that it is one of the most heavily amended acts in the Australian parliament. These changes come about when the prime minister changes hands, causing a shift in agenda or a general development or regression of workforce rights depending on the legislation amended or personal political stance.</p>

            <p>Employers have a legal and social responsibility to uphold the Fair Work Act 2009 lest they face legal ramifications. Some basic workers rights outlined in the Fair Work Act 2009 include the right to Flexible work arrangements in the context of childbirth or other domestic conditions as well as basic employee standards such as the standard employee full time workweek (38 hours) and conditional leave arrangements such as Sick leave or Bereavement leave. These standards are better detailed by NES, as these are the aforementioned National Employment Standards but they all originate from the Fair Work Act 2009 or some other statute laws or common law precedents.</p>

            <p>Many businesses tend to stay ‘off the books’ per say, paying their employees in cash which means their “employees” are not actually registered which can lead to a diminishment of workers rights. This is just one of the many problems that a properly developed HR department ensures to take responsibility for. HR’s duty in this category is to employ and consult experts in specific regard to the Fair Work Act in order to know what rules to bend in order to optimise cost and benefit but also know what is non-negotiable and will get them in deep legal mud.</p>

            <p>The Fair Work Act, in the context of Human Resources (HR) is deeply interconnected with NES and the Employment Contracts sectors of HR. Human Resources, as a company department, can be regarded as a company's most valuable employees. Rather than being delegated to cleanup, they serve to prevent incidents before they happen as well as restricting the freedom of employees through Employment Contracts but making sure it is all clean in the eyes of the law and making sure they tread carefully around workplace bullying/harassment and abuse of power.</p>

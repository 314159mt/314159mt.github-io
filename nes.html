            <h2>National Employment Standards (NES)</h2>
            <p>The National Employment Standards (NES) are a set of minimum employment entitlements that apply to all employees in Australia. These standards are outlined in the Fair Work Act 2009 and provide a safety net of rights and obligations in the workplace.</p>

            <h3>The minimum entitlements of the National Employment Standards are:</h3>

            <div class="nes-entitlement">
                <h4>Maximum weekly hours</h4>
                <p>The NES establishes maximum weekly hours for employees. An employer must not request or require an employee to work more than 38 hours per week, unless the additional hours are reasonable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="nes-entitlement">
                <h4>Requests for flexible working arrangements</h4>
                <p>Certain employees have the right to request flexible working arrangements regarding their work location, pattern, and hours. These employees include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parents or carers of a child who is of school age or younger</li>
                    <li>Carers</li>
                    <li>People with a disability</li>
                    <li>People aged 55 or older</li>
                    <li>Pregnant employees</li>
                    <li>Employees experiencing family and domestic violence, or supporting a family member experiencing family and domestic violence</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="nes-entitlement">
                <h4>Casual employment</h4>
                <p>A person is considered a casual employee if, at the commencement of their employment, there is no firm advance commitment to ongoing work, considering various factors. Casual employees are typically entitled to a casual loading or a specific casual pay rate as per an award, registered agreement, or employment contract.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="nes-entitlement">
                <h4>Parental leave and related entitlements and Personal/carer's leave, compassionate leave and family and domestic violence leave</h4>
                <p>Full-time and part-time employees are entitled to paid personal (sick) leave if they are unable to work due to personal illness or injury. Full-time employees receive 10 sick days per year, while part-time employees' entitlement is pro-rata. This leave can also be used to care for a sick, injured, or family member affected by an emergency. Unused sick and carer's leave accumulates from year to year. Employers may require proof of leave, such as a medical certificate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="nes-entitlement">
                <h4>Annual leave</h4>
                <p>Annual leave (or holiday pay) allows employees (except casual employees) to be paid while taking time off work. Full-time and part-time employees accrue 4 weeks of paid annual leave per year, based on their ordinary hours of work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="nes-entitlement">
                <h4>Community service leave</h4>
                <p>Employees can take community service leave for activities such as voluntary emergency service activities and jury duty.</p>
                <p>An employee taking community service leave must provide their employer with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Notice of the absence as soon as reasonably practicable (which may be after the leave has commenced)</li>
                    <li>The duration or expected duration of the absence</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="nes-entitlement">
                <h4>Long service leave</h4>
                <p>Employees become entitled to long service leave after a long period of continuous service with the same employer. The specific entitlement varies by state and territory. For example, in New South Wales, employees are generally entitled to two months (8.6667 weeks) of paid long service leave after 10 years of continuous service.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="nes-entitlement">
                <h4>Public holidays</h4>
                <p>All employees have the right to be absent from work on a public holiday. Employees who work on a public holiday may be entitled to extra pay, an extra day off, or minimum shift lengths, depending on their employment agreement or award.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="nes-entitlement">
                <h4>Superannuation contributions</h4>
                <p>Under the superannuation guarantee, employers are required to make superannuation contributions (currently 11.5%) of an employee's ordinary time earnings if the employee is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Over 18 years of age</li>
                    <li>Under 18 years of age and working more than 30 hours per week</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The superannuation guarantee applies to most types of employees.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="nes-entitlement">
                <h4>Notice of termination and redundancy pay</h4>
                <p>Both employers and employees may be required to provide notice when ending the employment relationship. There are also specific rules regarding what must be included in an employee's final pay.</p>
                <p>An employer must provide written notice of termination, which can be given by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delivering it personally</li>
                    <li>Leaving it at the employee's last known address</li>
                    <li>Sending it by pre-paid post to the employee's last known address</li>
                    <li>If the employee agrees, sending it electronically via email or text message</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Redundancy can occur due to various business reasons such as the introduction of new technology, business downturn, closure, relocation, or restructuring. When an employer makes an employee's position genuinely redundant, they are required to pay severance or redundancy pay.</p>
                <p>There are two types of redundancy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Genuine redundancy:</strong> This occurs when the employee's job is no longer required to be performed by anyone in the business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-genuine redundancy:</strong> This occurs when the employer still requires the job to be done by someone (e.g., hiring a new employee to perform the same role under different conditions). In cases of non-genuine redundancy, the employee may have grounds for an unfair dismissal claim.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="nes-entitlement">
                <h4>Fair Work Information Statement (the FWIS) and Casual Employment Information Statement (the CEIS)</h4>
                <p>Employers are obligated to provide every new employee with a copy of the Fair Work Information Statement (FWIS) before or as soon as practicable after they commence employment. The FWIS contains information on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The National Employment Standards</li>
                    <li>The right to request flexible working arrangements</li>
                    <li>Modern awards</li>
                    <li>Making agreements under the Fair Work Act 2009</li>
                    <li>Individual flexibility arrangements</li>
                    <li>Freedom of association and workplace rights (general protections)</li>
                    <li>Termination of employment</li>
                    <li>Right of entry</li>
                    <li>The roles of the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Fair Work Commission</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Employers must also provide casual employees with a Casual Employment Information Statement (CEIS) before or as soon as practicable after they start, and at other specific times during their employment. The CEIS includes information on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The definition of a casual employee</li>
                    <li>How casual employment can be changed, including the process for an employee to notify their employer of their intention to change to permanent employment</li>
                    <li>The reasons why an employer may not accept an employee's notification</li>
                    <li>The role of the Fair Work Commission in resolving disputes related to casual conversion</li>
                </ul>

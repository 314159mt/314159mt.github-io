            <h2>Acquisition</h2>
            <p>Acquisition is where the company is scouting for potential employees and hiring to fill in vacancies in the business. To do this, the HR management team will identify what roles need to be filled in the company as well as the qualifications needed for that role. Once the HR department has figured these out, the company will begin to advertise themselves to the labour force and will begin accepting applications. Once they have collated the best applications, company staff (those closely related to the role such as the management staff involved with that role) will then interview them to gauge who the best candidate is. If the staff are unsatisfied, the process will repeat until a satisfactory result has been met. Likewise, a candidate may not meet the needs for this role, but they may fit the needs of another role and will therefore be transitioned towards that position.</p>

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>Development is work done by HR and related staff (e.g managerial) to get the employee working at maximum efficiency in their new role. This happens over time and involves training the employee to be able to do their job properly, with performance appraisals conducted by the manager to provide formal feedback to the employee. Development is also used to train employees for a future scenario where they may need different skills to the ones they currently employ for their role (e.g. if management decides to transfer them to a new role, or if the way business is conducted has changed). Once HR and management is happy with their efforts (e.g. hands on advice/help with tasks, lessons provided on how to complete certain things, routine feedback through conversations/meetings or the aforementioned performance appraisals), HR will then focus on providing development for employees in need. Development is a very important part of the cycle because it can show HR what training strategies are working and if their hiring standards are up to scratch.</p>

            <h2>Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Maintenance is the stage in which the company will focus on retaining the employee and sustaining their motivation/drive to continue working. The legal responsibilities of the company must be maintained, thus meaning that the mental and physical wellbeing of the employees are prioritised over the static pursuit of efficiency. Incentives such as bonuses work to stimulate this desire to work harder by giving the employee a goal to work towards, with the achievement of the goal (work harder, etc) boosting their mental wellbeing through the acquisition of money. The provision of contractual benefits for the employee (e.g. free private health care, flexible working conditions) also helps to improve the employee employer relationship, while regular opportunities for the employee to improve their skills (or face promotion) will also make the employee feel that they are valued.</p>

            <h2>Separation</h2>
            <p>Separation is the process where the employment of the worker is ended, arising from various means (mutual exits where both parties enter into the agreement amicably, redundancies where the position of the worker is no longer needed or sackings/firings where the employee faces repercussions for their actions). For example Retirement is an amicable exit, where the employee has decided to exit the workforce (with most companies providing some sort of retirement bonus). Probation is where the employee has a set tenure at the company, with the conclusion of this time span then resulting in the decision made regarding the future of their place in the company (if they perform well, they are hired, if not, then they complete their tenure without the job). Temporary staff may be brought in to fill a gap until a more permanent replacement can be found. Likewise, if the employee has done a satisfactory enough job and the employee + employer are willing to enter into a more permanent relationship, such arrangements can be made.</p>

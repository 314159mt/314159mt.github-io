            <h2>Acquisition</h2>
            <p>Acquisition is where the company is scouting for potential employees and hiring to fill in vacancies in the business. To do this, the HR management team will identify what roles need to be filled in the company as well as the qualifications needed for that role. Once the HR department has figured these out, the company will begin to advertise themselves to the labour force and will begin accepting applications for the role. After applications are in, the HR team will then interview potential candidates and then make a decision on who to hire. Once the employee has been hired, they will then proceed to the next stage of the HR cycle.</p>

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>Development is the process of improving the skills and capabilities of the employee, which can be done through training, mentoring, or performance management. Training is where the employee is taught a specific skill that they need to improve in, with this training often done in-house. Mentoring is where a more experienced employee guides a less experienced one. Performance management is where the manager and employee meet to discuss the employeeâ€™s performance, setting goals and objectives for the employee to work towards.</p>

            <h2>Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Maintenance involves the business attempting to retain the employee and keep them motivated to work hard for the company. The company will seek to provide a safe and healthy work environment for the employee, as well as provide them with fair pay and benefits. The provision of contractual benefits for the employee (e.g. free private health care, flexible working conditions) also helps to improve the employee-employer relationship, while regular opportunities for the employee to improve their skills (or face promotion) will also make the employee feel that they are valued.</p>

            <h2>Separation</h2>
            <p>Separation is the process where the employment of the worker is ended, arising from various means (mutual exits where both parties enter into the agreement amicably, redundancies where the position of the worker is no longer needed, or sackings/firings where the employee faces repercussions for their actions). For example, retirement is an amicable exit, where the employee has decided to exit the workforce (with most companies providing some sort of retirement bonus). Probation is where the employee has a set tenure at the company, with the conclusion of this time span then resulting in the decision made regarding the future of their place in the company (if they perform well, they are hired; if not, then they complete their tenure without the job). Temporary staff may be brought in to fill a gap until a more permanent replacement can be found. Likewise, if the employee has done a satisfactory enough job and the employee and employer are willing to enter into a more permanent relationship, such arrangements can be made.</p>
